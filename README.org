* Overview
Common Lisp autowrap bindings to the [[http://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL2_gfx/Docs/html/index.html][SDL2_gfx]] library

This library was created by Wilfredo Velázquez-Rodríguez and modified/extended
by Ethan Smith.

* Installation

  If using quicklisp, download this repo to your local projects directory:

  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects/
    git clone https://github.com/ethanxxxl/cl-sdl2-gfx.git
  #+end_src


* Usage
  After installing the project on your system, you can load sdl2_gfx into a lisp
  image:

  #+begin_src lisp
    (ql:quickload :sdl2-gfx)
    (require :sdl2-gfx) ;; this may work as well, depending on implentation
  #+end_src

  Bindings for all modules within SDL2_gfx are generated:
  - SDL2_gfxPrimitives.h
  - SDL2_rotozoom.h
  - SDL2_framerate.h
  - SDL2_imageFilter.h
  - SDL2_gfxPrimitives_font.h

  All functions/definitions from SDL2_gfx will be loaded into the ~:sdl2-gfx~
  package.
